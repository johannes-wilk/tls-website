# README: TLS and UAV Campaigns â€“ Single-Page Website Setup

## Purpose

This README provides detailed, AI-executable instructions to generate a single-page JavaScript-based website. The goal is to present and communicate scientific work involving Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and UAV laser data collection. The final product must be clean, modern, visually engaging, intuitive, and usable during conferences and scientific talks. It will also act as a metadata repository for current and future research sites. The website must be compatible with both phone screens and computer screens.

The website will eventually be published via **Netlify**, so the output must be compatible with standard static hosting.

---

## Technical Requirements

* Use **HTML, CSS (Tailwind preferred)**, and **JavaScript**.
* Use a modern font that is not too common but still appealing to look at.
* Ensure mobile responsiveness.
* One-page scrolling structure (anchor-linked sections).
* Modern, clean, and accesible color scheme and semantic HTML.
* All scripts and assets must be self-contained (or CDN-loaded).

## Website Sections

### 1. Hero Section (Headline and Introduction)

* Full-width background image (`hero.jpg`).
* Large title: `Terrestrial & UAV Laser Campaigns Worldwide`
* Subtitle: `Advanced Forest Structure Monitoring with GFZ`
* One-sentence description: `We collect and process high-resolution 3D laser data from natural forests to analyze structural changes and carbon sinks.`

### 2. Map Section: Scan Locations

* Section title: **"Scan Locations"**
* Subtitle: `Global overview of our TLS and UAV data campaigns.`
* Use interactive **Leaflet.js** map.
* Load data from `locations.csv` containing columns: `status`, `Plot_name`, `lat`, `lon`, `Forest_type`, `Date`, `Data_type`, `Area`, `Scanpositions`, `Scannertype`
* Marker behavior:

  * Position based on `lat` and `lon`
  * Marker color:

    * Green: `status = done`
    * Orange: `status = planned`

  * Marker
    * TLS: a cross in shape of an "X"
    * UAV: a small figure in shape of an airplane

  * Tooltip on hover: `Plot_name`
  * Popup on click: Show other columns in a clean list (excluding  `status`,`Data_type`, `Scannertype`,`Forest_type`)
* Include a legend at the bottom right.

### 3. Section: Work Description

* Title: **"What We Do"**
* Three content blocks with 1:1 slide show images:

  * **Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS)**: Explain ground-based scanning.
   * We use two state-of-the-art ground-based laser scanners: Riegl VZ400i and VZ600i.
   * Data is collected following standard grid or RINGO protocols in forest plots.
   * TLS allows us to capture detailed 3D representations of complex vegetation structures.
   * Our equipment is capable of handling both small and extensive plots in challenging environments.
   * This method delivers high-resolution point clouds that enable structural forest analysis.
  * **UAV Lidar**: Describe airborne data collection.
   * We operate two Riegl lidar systems: VUX-120 and MiniVUX.
   * VUX-120 enables high-detail scanning, ideal for precision studies.
   * MiniVUX offers extended flight time with slightly reduced resolution for broader coverage.
   * Two UAV platforms allow us to flexibly adapt to mission scale and terrain.
   * UAV lidar is crucial for rapid and large-scale data acquisition across diverse forest types.
  * **Postprocessing**: Summarize data fusion, alignment, and structural metric extraction.
   * We register, align, and filter point clouds for maximum clarity and usability.
   * High-resolution terrain models are produced: DTM (Digital Terrain Model), DSM (Surface Model), and DEM (Elevation Model).
   * We apply tree segmentation algorithms for individual tree detection and structure extraction.
   * Structural metrics are derived to support forest monitoring, biomass analysis, and carbon accounting.
   * All processing steps follow reproducible scientific protocols.

### 4. Section: Site Gallery & Details

* Title: **"Field Sites"**
* Each field site is displayed as a card.
* The card should be in a responsive layout that extends the full width of the site showing the images at one half or third and on the rest of the card text information for each field site.
* All cards come one after the other.
* Each block shows:

  * A slideshow or image carousel that can be clicked or navigated to show multiple images per site.
  * Site name as the block title.
  * A basic description paragraph with key site characteristics, campaign purpose, or notable results.
  * Optionally, a button or link to related publications, data access requests, or external resources.

* Ensure the layout adapts well to desktop and mobile views.
* Use clean transitions and navigation icons for the image carousel.

### 5. Section: Partners and Contact

* Title: **"Collaborators & Contact"**
* Logos of collaborating institutions (placeholder images acceptable)
* Contact information:

  * Name: Johannes Wilk
  * Email address: wilk@gfz.de
  * Optionally embed a contact form

## Deployment Instructions (for AI)

1. Generate all required HTML, CSS, and JS files.
2. Use `map.js` for Leaflet map implementation.
3. Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) or custom CSS with minimal style.
4. Store assets in a folder named `assets/` (e.g., `assets/images/hero.jpg`, `assets/data/locations.csv`).
5. Ensure proper `<meta>` tags in `<head>` for mobile support.
6. Prepare the project for publishing on Netlify (i.e., all static files in root or `public/` folder).

## Final Notes

* Keep design light and professional.
* Ensure clear code comments.
* Focus on visual hierarchy, consistency, and ease of navigation.
* Website must be easy to extend and update.

This README should guide any AI system or human developer in generating a coherent and compelling one-page scientific portfolio site.
